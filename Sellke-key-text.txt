H_0 : D_i has negligible effect versus
H_1 : D_i has a non-negligible effect

Suppose that one of these tests results in a p value of .05 (or ~ .01).  

How strong is the evidence that the drug in question has a non-negligible
effect? 

To study this, we will simply collect all the p values from a large number of
such tests, and record how often the null hypothesis is true for p values at
various levels.


Note that the null hypotheses, H 0 , have special plausibil- ity in these
tests; many experimental drugs that are tested have “negligible e¡ect,” so that
these null hypotheses could reasonably be true. [This is related to the earlier
comment that we are only concerned with the testing of “precise” hy- potheses.
See Berger, Boukai, and Wang (1997) for further discussion.]
